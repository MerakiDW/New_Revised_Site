SMACSS (pronounced “smacks”) is more style guide than rigid framework. 
There is no library within here for you to download or install. 
SMACSS is a way to examine your design process and as a way to fit 
those rigid frameworks into a flexible thought process.

SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS) is considered a mainstream CSS methodology.
